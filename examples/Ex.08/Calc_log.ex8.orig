          Minimum Time Step:                              1.000000     (s)
          Maximum number of Newton-Raphson iterations for a time step:  10
          Average number of Newton-Raphson iterations per time step:   4.8

          Average number of GMRES iterations per solve:                3.1

          Factors Controlling Time Step Length:
                0 - (P) Maximum pressure change
                0 - (H) Maximum enthalpy change
                5 - (W) Maximum water saturation change
               36 - (M) Maximum time step increase
                2 - (D) Time to read new input data
              249 - (O) Time to write output data
                1 - (R) Reset to value before reading new data
              227 - (R) Reset to value before writing output data
                1 - (I) Value for initial time step
                0 - (M) Maximum time step allowed

          Reasons for Cutting the Time Step Length:
                0 - (P) Pressure change exceeded maximum allowed
                0 - (H) Enthalpy change exceeded maximum allowed
               17 - (W) Saturation change exceeded maximum allowed
                0 - (C) Excessive multiple nodes changed phase in a N-R iteration
                0 - (C) Excessive multiple nodes changed phase in a time step
                0 - (I) Maximum N-R iterations reached without convergence
                0 - (N) Newton-Raphson iterations stalled out
                0 - (T) Pressure or enthalpy exceeded limits of enthalpy tables
                0 - (T) Pressure below limits of enthalpy tables
                0 - (L) Pressure exceeded lithostatic limit
                0 - (G) GMRES solver failed to converge

          Convergence Criteria Satisfied:
              403 - (R) Mass and energy residuals (input)
               46 - (C) Absolute changes in pressure and enthalpy (hard coded)
               72 - (%) Percent changes in pressure and enthalpy from previous step (input)
