          --- Summary data for completed simulation ---

          Total number of time steps:                              50
          Total number of Newton-Raphson iterations:               88
          Initial Time:                                   0.000000     (yr)
          Ending Time:                                    10000.00     (yr)
          Avg Time Step Length:                           200.0000     (yr)
          Maximum Time Step:                              1743.389     (yr)
          Minimum Time Step:                             1.0000000E-02 (yr)
          Maximum number of Newton-Raphson iterations for a time step:   2
          Average number of Newton-Raphson iterations per time step:   1.8

          Factors Controlling Time Step Length:
                0 - (P) Maximum pressure change
                0 - (H) Maximum enthalpy change
                0 - (W) Maximum water saturation change
               46 - (M) Maximum time step increase
                1 - (D) Time to read new input data
                1 - (O) Time to write output data
                0 - (R) Reset to value before reading new data
                1 - (R) Reset to value before writing output data
                1 - (I) Value for initial time step
                0 - (M) Maximum time step allowed

          Reasons for Cutting the Time Step Length:
                0 - (P) Pressure change exceeded maximum allowed
                0 - (H) Enthalpy change exceeded maximum allowed
                0 - (W) Saturation change exceeded maximum allowed
                0 - (C) Excessive multiple nodes changed phase in a N-R iteration
                0 - (C) Excessive multiple nodes changed phase in a time step
                0 - (I) Maximum N-R iterations reached without convergence
                0 - (N) Newton-Raphson iterations stalled out
                0 - (T) Pressure or enthalpy exceeded limits of enthalpy tables
                0 - (T) Pressure below limits of enthalpy tables
                0 - (L) Pressure exceeded lithostatic limit
                0 - (G) GMRES solver failed to converge

          Convergence Criteria Satisfied:
               50 - (R) Mass and energy residuals (input)
                0 - (C) Absolute changes in pressure and enthalpy (hard coded)
                0 - (%) Percent changes in pressure and enthalpy from previous step (input)
                  Maximum residual for Mass:   -8.42E-13; at Time Step   14
                  Maximum residual for Energy: -7.12E-03; at Time Step   14
