          Average number of Newton-Raphson iterations per time step:   2.7

          Factors Controlling Time Step Length:
               53 - (P) Maximum pressure change
                0 - (H) Maximum enthalpy change
                0 - (W) Maximum water saturation change
                0 - (M) Maximum time step increase
                1 - (D) Time to read new input data
                9 - (O) Time to write output data
                0 - (R) Reset to value before reading new data
                7 - (R) Reset to value before writing output data
                1 - (I) Value for initial time step
                0 - (M) Maximum time step allowed

          Reasons for Cutting the Time Step Length:
                1 - (P) Pressure change exceeded maximum allowed
                0 - (H) Enthalpy change exceeded maximum allowed
