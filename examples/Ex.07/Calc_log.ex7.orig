          Average number of GMRES iterations per solve:               10.5

          Factors Controlling Time Step Length:
                5 - (P) Maximum pressure change
                0 - (H) Maximum enthalpy change
               10 - (W) Maximum water saturation change
               34 - (M) Maximum time step increase
                5 - (D) Time to read new input data
               24 - (O) Time to write output data
                0 - (R) Reset to value before reading new data
               17 - (R) Reset to value before writing output data
                4 - (I) Value for initial time step
                0 - (M) Maximum time step allowed

          Reasons for Cutting the Time Step Length:
                2 - (P) Pressure change exceeded maximum allowed
                0 - (H) Enthalpy change exceeded maximum allowed
                3 - (W) Saturation change exceeded maximum allowed
                0 - (C) Excessive multiple nodes changed phase in a N-R iteration
                0 - (C) Excessive multiple nodes changed phase in a time step
                0 - (I) Maximum N-R iterations reached without convergence
                0 - (N) Newton-Raphson iterations stalled out
                0 - (T) Pressure or enthalpy exceeded limits of enthalpy tables
                0 - (T) Pressure below limits of enthalpy tables
                0 - (L) Pressure exceeded lithostatic limit
                0 - (G) GMRES solver failed to converge

          Convergence Criteria Satisfied:
              104 - (R) Mass and energy residuals (input)
                0 - (C) Absolute changes in pressure and enthalpy (hard coded)
                0 - (%) Percent changes in pressure and enthalpy from previous step (input)
