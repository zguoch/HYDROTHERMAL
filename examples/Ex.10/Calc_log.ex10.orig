          Ending Time:                                    10000.00     (yr)
          Avg Time Step Length:                           36.63004     (yr)
          Maximum Time Step:                              267.3086     (yr)
          Minimum Time Step:                             1.0000000E-03 (yr)
          Maximum number of Newton-Raphson iterations for a time step:   8
          Average number of Newton-Raphson iterations per time step:   3.0

          Factors Controlling Time Step Length:
                6 - (P) Maximum pressure change
               72 - (H) Maximum enthalpy change
               24 - (W) Maximum water saturation change
               41 - (M) Maximum time step increase
                3 - (D) Time to read new input data
               21 - (O) Time to write output data
                0 - (R) Reset to value before reading new data
               11 - (R) Reset to value before writing output data
                1 - (I) Value for initial time step
                0 - (M) Maximum time step allowed

          Reasons for Cutting the Time Step Length:
                0 - (P) Pressure change exceeded maximum allowed
               17 - (H) Enthalpy change exceeded maximum allowed
               17 - (W) Saturation change exceeded maximum allowed
                5 - (C) Excessive multiple nodes changed phase in a N-R iteration
                0 - (C) Excessive multiple nodes changed phase in a time step
                0 - (I) Maximum N-R iterations reached without convergence
                0 - (N) Newton-Raphson iterations stalled out
                0 - (T) Pressure or enthalpy exceeded limits of enthalpy tables
                0 - (T) Pressure below limits of enthalpy tables
                0 - (L) Pressure exceeded lithostatic limit
                0 - (G) GMRES solver failed to converge

          Convergence Criteria Satisfied:
              272 - (R) Mass and energy residuals (input)
                0 - (C) Absolute changes in pressure and enthalpy (hard coded)
                1 - (%) Percent changes in pressure and enthalpy from previous step (input)
                  Maximum residual for Mass:    8.87E-15; at Time Step   51
                  Maximum residual for Energy:  2.57E-04; at Time Step   51
